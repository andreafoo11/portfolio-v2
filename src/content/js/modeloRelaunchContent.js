            Despite its 2014 launch, Modelo, a small product within our parent
            company Coohom, had received limited resources and development
            attention. However, upon my joining in 2013, the company decided to
            relaunch Modelo 2.0 in the US, and I was actively involved in this
            effort.

          <p>
            The relaunch was successful in terms of user satisfaction with the
            new features and overall revamp, and we effectively communicated the
            value propositions. However, we failed to identify and target the
            right users, resulting in low CTR and limited user growth
            post-launch (reaching only 400 users in a week). We assumed we could
            revitalize a portion of our 48,000 existing users, but this
            assumption proved incorrect.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Looking back, we should have investigated why users abandoned our
            product before the relaunch. Our attempts at this were unsuccessful,
            and we quickly realized our limitations in attracting users back
            after the launch, highlighting the importance of pre-launch research
            in this area.
